This project is an E-learning clone platform developed.
We used for the front end : html , css , javascript and bootstrap (a framework) .
for the back end we used : php and databases .

In order for this website to work properly you need to  ( we will run it locally ): 
1) Install a software that will run the php code : we propose WAMP or XAMPP 

2)Run WAMP or XAMPP

3) Set the database necessary for the sign in / sign up system to work properly and to be able to change the profile picture within this website : 
	a/Open your browser ( we recommand opera for minimum bugs that you may face )
	b/Type localhost/phpmyadmin/ then for the username : root 
				                  password : (leave it empty )
then click on "go" 

 4)click on "Databases" ( Bases de donn√©es )  then write inside the Database Name : "loginsystemtut" then click on "create"

5)click on the "Import" tab up top and then write this data loginsystemtut.sql in folder db
  
6) click "go" or "execute" 

7)Now open any browser you want and write "localhost/e-learning" and click enter to use it .

Note : 
The steps above are only followed when you try to use the website for the first time  ( because we need to set the database ) otherwise you ignore them and do these two steps : 

1)Run the software "WAMP" or "XAMPP"

2)open any browser you want and write "localhost/e-learning" and click enter to use the website
